# BlackHatWithGo
I am not a developer but I am a big fan of the "Black Hat Python" book by Justin Seitz and Tim Arnold.

I wanted to take the concepts introduced in that book and recreate them using GO. Why Go?, I wanted to learn a new language, I know some Python and some Pascal from years ago but I want to expand my horizons. Since I don't have a lot of programming experience I though C or C++ probably a bit too much to take on. I considered RUST, but Go just seemed simpler to get started with.

This repo is paired with my Youtube videos www.youtube.com/@Securesushi, where I will attempt to build out the GO code.
